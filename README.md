# react-practice
This repository stores various React practice projects and work from a number of online sources such as Scrimba and freeCodeCamp. 

**Projects/Work:**
1. **Markup** - A basic example of using React to populate a simple page. CDN links are included for local use.

2. **Business Card** - This is a template of a business card that I worked on in order to gain a basic understanding of React components and how to integrate different files together into one app/page. All files were written within a Scrimba console. The image used in the card is from Pexels (https://www.pexels.com/) and is by Andrea Piacquadio.
