# react-practice
This repository stores various React practice projects and work from a number of online sources such as Scrimba and freeCodeCamp. 

**Projects/Work:**
1. **Markup** - A basic example of using React to populate a simple page. CDN links are included for local use.

2. **Business Card** - This is a template of a business card that I worked on in order to gain a basic understanding of React components and how to integrate different files together into one app/page. All files were written within a Scrimba console. The image used in the card is from Pexels (https://www.pexels.com/) and is by Andrea Piacquadio.

3. **Travel Journal** - I created this page as a way to practice using React props. This is a static page, since all of the data that I used was hardcoded before hand, in which I focused on developing an overall understanding of the concept of props and there applicable uses. This was a solo project from Scrimba and although I referenced parts of the course, the code iteself was written from scratch. All files were written within a Scrimba console. The images that I used in the page are from Pexels (https://www.pexels.com/) and are by Raphael Loquellano, Rajesh Rathod, and Sam Lovel.

4. **Basic Form** - Here is a simple form that I made to practice working, and interacting, with React state. I omitted any meaningful styling via CSS as I wanted to focus only on the general concept of state and how it functions within React. As the user interacts with the provided inputs the text below the form is updated with the current values. If submitted, the state object is logged in the console. For this excercise I used a newly created React App, via npm.
